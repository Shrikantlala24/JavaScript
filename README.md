## 🎯 **What is this?**  
A collection of my experiments, projects, and resources while I dive deep into:

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
Here’s my toolkit for the adventure:  
### **Frontend** 🖼️  
- **HTML5** & **CSS3**: The skeleton and the glow!  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The brain of the operation.  
- **React**: Because components make everything better.  

### **Backend** 🔧  
- **Node.js**: JavaScript on the server? Yes, please!  
- **Express.js**: Smooth server handling made easy.  

### **Databases** 🗂️
